# Sorting Visualizer
Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer project! This project is a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementation aimed at visualizing various sorting algorithms. You can visualize popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.

Demo
You can try out the Sorting Visualizer live at https://prachivisualizer.netlify.app/.

Algorithms Implemented
Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Selection Sort: A sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted.
Insertion Sort: A sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.
Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts each half independently, and then merges the two sorted halves.
Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
Heap Sort: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements.
